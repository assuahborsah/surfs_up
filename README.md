# surfs_up
# Project Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to gather information about weather and temperature trends before opening a surf shop.

To determine if the surf and ice cream shop is going to be viable year-round, the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu will need to be analyzed.

# Resources

Jupyter Notebook, Python, Pandas, Visual Studio Code

Data Source: hawaii.sqlite

# Results

•	The June temperature analysis indicates the average monthly temperature is 74.9 (F), the monthly max temperature is 85.0 (F) and the monthly min temperature is 64.0 (F).

•	The December temperature analysis indicates the average monthly temperature is 71.0 (F), the monthly max temperature is 83.0 (F) and the monthly min temperature is 56.0 (F).

# Summary
The standard deviation in the June temperatures is slightly smaller (3.26) compared to the standard deviation in the December temperature (3.75), this impacts temperature ranges and temperature fluctuations. The range of temperatures in June are smaller and therefore warmer compared to the range of temperatures in December, which are larger and therefore colder.

With this said it can be concluded that the surf and ice cream will be viable year-round. In the sense that maximum temperatures for the months of June and December will be around middle 80(F).
